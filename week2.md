## Content Insights 
I learned that Joomla organizes its content into Articles, which are the main components of the site, and Menus are used to link these articles and other pages together, creating navigation for the website.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Learning Joomla improves my ability to manage and build websites, which is valuable in web development. Knowing how to use Joomlaâ€™s tools like articles, menus, and media helps me manage websites better and be more flexible in web development. Using CMS can help me improve problem-solving skills by learning to fix issues, adjust settings, and make sure the website works well on different devices. Familiarity with Joomla prepares me for web development roles where CMSs are commonly used.
