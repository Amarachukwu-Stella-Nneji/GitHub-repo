#### Availability & Commitment:
Individuals manage conflicting commitments by either using voting to make decisions or by checking each individual’s strengths and weaknesses.

Individuals are comfortable with both online tools and in-person meetings, and they approach group tasks using a mix of structured planning and flexible collaboration. Many prefer to follow a set plan while some are open to taking on leadership roles, and decision-making is most often achieved through voting, with some information coming from individual suggestions and brainstorming.

Effective communication is mostly seen as essential for a successful team, with emphasis on independence and self-leadership, whereas the biggest challenge involves ensuring consistent contributions from everyone and managing their different availabilities.
