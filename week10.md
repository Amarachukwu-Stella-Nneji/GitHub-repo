## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Rehearsing the presentation gave me practice with public speaking, which is something I know I’ll need in professional settings,  Whether reporting on a project, pitching an idea, or presenting findings, clear and confident communication is key.

Working closely with my team under a deadline also felt like a real-world experience in project coordination.

I’ve realized that being able to explain ideas in a simple and confident way is just as important as the technical knowledge itself. This experience has made me more aware of how important soft skills such as teamwork, time management are in the workplace.
