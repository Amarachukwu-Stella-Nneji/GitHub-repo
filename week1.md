## (Learning Activities & Resources) 
I went back to my previous course to remind myself of how to write HTML  for website contents and structure,  JavaScript  for form validation and CSS for site styling. Also reminded myself on how to use SiteGround for web hosting but I didnâ€™t use it because it was a bit confusing.

## (Content Insight):
 Refreshing my knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS reminded me how they work hand in hand to build and improve  functionality and eye catching websites. I also learned that choosing a hosting service can be challenging, as not all platforms are beginner-friendly. My experience with SiteGround and Bluehost  showed me the importance of user-friendly hosting platforms, that is why I had to  go for GitHub Pages. This process also taught me to test with different tools and find  out what works best for me
