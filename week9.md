Two Formats: Sass has two formats: the indented format (.sass) and the SCSS format (.scss).

Indented Format: The .sass format eliminates much of the punctuation found in CSS, making it simpler but whitespace-sensitive.

SCSS Format: The .scss format is 100% CSS compatible, allowing you to copy and paste existing CSS directly. It retains all CSS punctuation, making it more familiar to those used to writing CSS.

Sass encourages the use of the DRY principle(Don't Repeat Yourself).
