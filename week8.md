## Learning Activities & Resources
This week, I conducted a learning experiment to test different note-taking methods while watching pre-recorded lecture videos. The goal was to determine whether delayed recall note-taking improves my understanding and retention compared to active note-taking.

Resources used: Pre-recorded lecture videos from my coursework

## Estimated Hours
1.5 hours

## Content Insights 
Delayed note-taking seemed to help with understanding concepts rather than just recording information.

Active note-taking is useful for capturing details.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Learning how to retain and recall information efficiently is an important skill for both academics and professional life.
Developing better study techniques will help with exam preparation and problem-solving in technical fields.

## Learning Experiment
## Hypothesis
Before, i watch the lecture pre recorded video and take notes under subheadings and the additional information mentioned by lecturer that aren't included in the notes
But now i tried just watching the video, try to understand it without interrupting and then after some minutes into the video, i pause and write down what i understood/remembered so far from what i had watched for the past minutes.

## Test to Prove or Disprove the Hypothesis
### Step 1: Select Two Lecture Videos
Choose two different lecture videos from coursework.

### Step 2: Apply Two Different Note-Taking Methods
Watch the first lecture video while actively taking notes, writing down key points and additional information mentioned by the lecturer.  

Watch the second lecture video without taking notes. After some minutes, pause and write down everything understood from memory.

### Step 3: Compare Results
### Analyze:
Which method helped recall more key points accurately?

Did I find delayed note-taking more engaging?

Which method made reviewing easier and more effective?

If I remember more from the delayed note-taking,then it supports the hypothesis that this method improves retention and understanding.

## Results:
### Retention: 
I remembered more details from the lecture where I used delayed note-taking compared to actively taking notes, but it takes more time.

### Understanding: 
I felt that the delayed note-taking forced me to actively process and make use of the material rather than passively writing it down.

### Effort and Engagement: 
While the delayed note-taking required more mental effort, it made me more engaged with the lecture instead of just copying information.
