## Content Insights 
Child themes allows developers customise a website’s appearance and functionality without modifying the files of the parent theme, ensuring that parent theme updates won’t overwrite their changes. Child themes allow for the edits to be saved and not be affected by updates to the parent theme. When edits are made directly to the parent theme, updates can overwrite and erase those changes, but using a child theme preserves the customisations, allowing them to be seamlessly applied alongside any new updates to the parent theme.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Proficiency in creating and managing child themes also demonstrates the ability to build flexible, update-friendly websites that can adapt to changing client needs. This skill offers meaningful long-term benefits, providing immediate customization options while ensuring long-term project sustainability. It's highly valued in the industry because it allows websites to quickly adapt to updates and client requirements, enhancing overall project sustainability.
