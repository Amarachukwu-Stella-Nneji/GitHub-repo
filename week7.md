## Content Insights 
PHP can be used for making large websites because it helps in reducing duplicate code and maintains consistency across multiple pages. With the use of functions includes, code can be organised into reusable components to reduce redundancy.
PHP uses "include" statements which allow for code snippets, headers, footers or whole PHP files to be included in pages. This helps to maintain consistency across the website by making sure that changes made to included files are seen on all pages where they are included.
